=========

Application for interacting with WT chip timing boxes. 

Using a serial port monitor I captured and decoded communications between the device and the supplied program.
This allowed me to interact with the device using a seperate device to perform the same functions as the original program, but with the ability to interact with the data is new ways rather than just dumping it to a file.
